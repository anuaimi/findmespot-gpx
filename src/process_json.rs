// get the filename from the command params

// load the file

// parse the json to file the Positions
//    d/Assets/Possitions

// for each position, extract
//    Id
//    Lat/Long/Altitude
//    Address
//    Time

// go through the rest of the files and merge into one set of positions (remove duplicates)
// print the earliers and last dates
// print out if any days during trip don't have a position - Jan 4th to now (yesterday)
// see if we have all the positions

// write as gpx file and then map and double check we have all the data
// separate the positions in a track for each day

// add the missing positions at the beginning of the trip
// take each hotel and add a position
//  Clevland
//  Nashville
//  Houston
//  Chihuahua

// use google maps to create routes for each day??
